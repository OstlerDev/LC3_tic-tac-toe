 ; We can create a "pseudo" random variable to give the AI some variablility


 ; AI pseudo-code

 ; function ticTacToeAI(board):
 ;    for each cell in board:
 ;        if cell is empty:
 ;            # Check if AI can win
 ;            if placing AI's symbol here makes AI win:
 ;                return cell's position

 ;    for each cell in board:
 ;        if cell is empty:
 ;            # Check if opponent can win
 ;            if placing opponent's symbol here makes them win:
 ;                return cell's position

 ;    if center is empty:
 ;        return center's position

 ;    for each corner in corners:
 ;        if corner is empty:
 ;            return corner's position

 ;    for each cell in board:
 ;        if cell is empty:
 ;            return cell's position
