# LC-3 Tic-Tac-Toe
## Overview
This LC-3 Tic-Tac-Toe program is an implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, where two players (one human and one AI) take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This program is designed to run on the LC-3 simulator, providing an interactive and engaging experience.

## Gameplay Features
- Interactive input system for selecting grid positions.
- Real-time updating of the gameboard after each move.
- Intelligent AI opponent with a variety of strategies.
- Checks for win, loss, and tie conditions.
- Option to replay after a game concludes.

## Running the Program
1. Run `./build.sh` to compile all files into one.
2. Load `main-all.asm` into the LC-3 simulator
3. Compile and run in LC3Tools
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play
Players make moves by selecting a row (A, B, C) and a column (1, 2, 3). For example, to select the top-right cell, the player would input "A3". The game alternates between the human player and the AI opponent, updating the gameboard after each turn.
